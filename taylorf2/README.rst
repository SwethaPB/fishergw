TaylorF2 bibliography
---------------------

The ``TaylorF2`` template in this module restricts to the (l=2,m=2) harmonic. 

The expressions for the amplitude and phase of the waveform are extracted from the following papers [#]_

- Point particle terms up to 3.5PN in the phase: Eq.s (B6-13) in `1508.07253 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07253>`_
- Spin-induced terms up to 3.5PN in the phase (we included the effects of quadrupole corrections at 3PN, but we neglected quadrupole and octupole corrections at 3.5PN, which are given as well in the same paper) : Eq.s (0.5a-c) in `1701.06318 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06318>`_
- Terms up to 3.5PN in the amplitude__: Eq.s (B14-20) in  `1508.07253 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07253>`_
- __Tidal terms at 5PN and 6PN in the phase__: Eq.s (14-16) in `1410.8866 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8866>`_

.. [#] These paper were not necessarily the first to present the corresponding expressions. We just refer to them for simplicity.
