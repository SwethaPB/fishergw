The `TaylorF2` template in this module restricts to the (l=2,m=2) harmonic. 

The expressions for the amplitude and phase of the waveform are extracted from the following papers (_note_: we do not claim that these paper were necessarily the first to present the corresponding expressions; we just refer to them for simplicity):

- __Point particle terms up to 3.5PN in the phase__: Eq.s (B6-13) in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07253](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07253)
- __Spin-induced terms up to 3.5PN in the phase__ (we included the effects of quadrupole corrections at 3PN, but we neglected quadrupole and octupole corrections at 3.5PN, which are given as well in the same paper) : Eq.s (0.5a-c) in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06318](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06318)
- __Terms up to 3.5PN in the amplitude__: Eq.s (B14-20) in  [https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07253](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07253)
- __Tidal terms at 5PN and 6PN in the phase__: Eq.s (14-16) in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8866](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8866)
